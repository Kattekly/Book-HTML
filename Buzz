      <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
      <p>
        "A man, a plan, a coffee bean". Okay, that doesn't make a palindrome, but it resulted
        in a damn good cup of coffee.  Starbuzz's CEO is that man, and you already know his 
        plan: a Starbuzz on every corner.
      </p> 
      <p>In only a few years he's executed that plan and today 
        you can enjoy Starbuzz just about anywhere.  And, of course, the big news this year 
        is that Starbuzz teamed up with Head First readers to create Starbuzz's Web presence,  
        which is growing rapidly and helping to meet the caffeine needs of a whole new set of 
        customers.  
      </p>

		<h1>Starbuzz meets social media</h1>

	<p>
<p>
		Here at Starbuzz we're embracing the social media craze. 
		In fact, we're going further than any of our competitors and 
		we're very close to announcing a revolutionary new product that 
		links your coffee drinking directly to your social 
		network. Forget "checking in"; we're going way beyond that, and 
		with this new product every sip of smooth, aromatic, hot Starbuzz 
		blend is going to to be shared with your social network.
	</p>
	<p>
		Sound like science fiction?  It's not; I'm already 
		testing our final prototype social network cup as I write this, 
		which links you, the drinker, right to your favorite social 
		networks.  We've made a huge investment to make this happen 
		and we've created a reusable coffee cup complete with RFID, 
		NFC, Bluetooth, and Wifi (not to mention a few more things the tech 
		folks know about, because hey, I'm just the coffee guy).
	</p>
	<p>
		So, keep your eyes out for this amazing new cup. And I'll 
		be releasing a video teaser soon to tell you all about this 
		new invention, straight from Starbuzz Coffee.
